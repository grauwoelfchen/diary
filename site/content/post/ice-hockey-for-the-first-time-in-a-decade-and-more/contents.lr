== 25:45 - 27:15, 11th Feb 2023 JST

At night of the last Friday, I played ice hockey with friends for the first +
time in a decade and more! (maybe more than 15+ years?)

Yes! It started at _25:45_, as it used to be so always!

In the video below, I wore uniform number 81, lightly swung at and missed +
a shot at the end ;)

It was a plesant time.


== Acknowledgement

Apparently, it seems some community-based teams we knew dissolved and +
ice rinks were closed in these years. So, playing ice hockey in Tokyo likely +
gets a bit harder than before year by year.

In additon to that, there was another challenge on there. +
... We felt our age! We couldn't move faster than we thought at all. And Iâ€™m +
still aching all over due to muscular fatigue even after several days, ha ha.

I appreciate the organizers, buddies and active student players all who came
for this!
